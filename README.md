# Labo VR Video Converter 
A simple GUI tool designed to convert pre-existing 180Â° VR video to the format that the Labo VR for Nintendo Switch uses.

# Usage
Run the program with Java 8 or newer, then select your input video and the output directory. It will automatically name the file to replace whatever VR video is in its place on the Labo. The program will hide itself until it is done, when you are able to load it into your fs-mitm on the console. You'll need FFMPEG for the conversion process.
